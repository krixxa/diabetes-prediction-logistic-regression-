Diabetes prediction using Logistic Regression | Python | Scikit-learn | ML Classification


Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy – for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – for data visualization
Scikit-learn – for model building and evaluation

Steps Followed
Data Loading & Cleaning – Imported dataset and handled missing or invalid values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized feature relationships and distributions.
Feature Scaling – Standardized numerical features for better model performance.
Model Training – Used Logistic Regression to predict diabetes outcomes.
Model Evaluation – Measured accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualized the confusion matrix.
